        From paper:
        RetinaNet uses feature pyramid levels P3 to P7, where P3 to P5 are computed
        from the output of the corresponding ResNet residual stage (C3 through C5)
        using top-down and lateral connections just as in [19], P6 is obtained via
        a 3×3 stride-2 conv on C5, and P7 is computed by apply- ing ReLU followed
        by a 3×3 stride-2 conv on P6. This differs slightly from [19]: (1) we don’t
        use the high-resolution pyramid level P2 for com- putational reasons,
        (2) P6 is computed by strided convolution instead of downsampling,
        and (3) we include P7 to improve large object detection.
        These minor modifications improve speed while maintaining accuracy.
